    <h2 id="pricing-title" class="section__title">Pricing</h2>
    <p class="section__lead">Our design pricing depends on the <strong>scope</strong> (number of pages, illustrations, or complexity of the design), <strong>format</strong> (print vs. digital), and <strong>customization level</strong> (standard layouts vs. bespoke design). This ensures you pay only for what you need.</p>

    <p>To help streamline your project, we also offer <strong>bundled packages</strong>. For example, combining <em>Cover Design + Layout</em> ensures consistent branding inside and out, while <em>Layout + Illustrations</em> is perfect for research and children’s books. Bundles are both cost-effective and time-efficient, handled by one design team.</p>
