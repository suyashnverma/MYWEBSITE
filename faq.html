          editing, translation, design, and creative fields. By working with contributors directly under our open-sourcing model,
          we are able to keep publishing costs affordable without compromising quality. There are no hidden charges — everything is transparent.

          The funds are released to the contributor only when you confirm that you’re satisfied with the delivered work.
          A small administrative fee is retained by us to cover facilitation costs.

          Our escrow-style system balances both sides. Contributors know their efforts will be compensated,
          while clients know their funds are secure until they’re satisfied with the work.
