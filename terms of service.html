  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Terms of Service – Satyartha Publishing</h1>
  <p class="mb-6"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Welcome to Satyartha Publishing (“Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). By accessing or using our website and services,
    you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). Please read them carefully before engaging
    with our services.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Scope of Services</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Satyartha Publishing provides facilitation, publishing support, and project management by connecting clients with vetted
    contributors, including writers, editors, translators, designers, and other professionals. Contributors act as independent
    contractors and are not employees of the Company. We assist in streamlining the publishing process but do not guarantee
    specific publishing outcomes (such as acceptance by third-party publishers, platforms, or distributors) unless explicitly
    stated in a written agreement.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. Contracts Between Clients and Contributors</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
    <li>Before any service begins, a formal contract is drawn between the client and the assigned contributor.</li>
    <li>This contract governs project details, deliverables, timelines, payments, and confidentiality.</li>
    <li>The client is responsible for carefully reviewing and approving the contract before work commences.</li>
    <li>Satyartha Publishing may provide templates and guidelines for contracts but is not a party to the service agreement.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. Role of Satyartha Publishing</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
    <li>The Company acts as a facilitator and arbitrator, ensuring fairness and adherence to guidelines.</li>
    <li>We are not responsible for the independent actions, misconduct, or negligence of contributors.</li>
    <li>In case of disputes, Satyartha Publishing may mediate between client and contributor in good faith but cannot be held liable for damages or outcomes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. Payments and Refunds</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Escrow Holding:</strong> All payments made by the client for contributor services are first held securely by Satyartha Publishing, acting as a neutral facilitator (similar to an escrow).</li>
    <li><strong>Company Service Fee:</strong> A small portion of the total service charge is retained by the Company as an administrative and facilitation fee. The remainder is reserved for the contributor.</li>
    <li><strong>Release of Funds:</strong> Once the contributor delivers the agreed work and the client confirms satisfaction, the reserved payment is transferred to the contributor.</li>
    <li><strong>Contributor Safeguards:</strong> If a client withdraws or fails to uphold contractual terms, the contributor will be remunerated from the safely held funds in proportion to work completed and expenses incurred, as outlined in the client–contributor contract.</li>
    <li><strong>Refunds to Clients:</strong> Refunds are available only if the contributor has not commenced work, or as expressly provided in the client–contributor contract. The Company’s administrative fee is non-refundable. Disputes about quality will be handled through mediation/arbitration rather than automatic refunds.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">5. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
    <li>All rights to submitted manuscripts, documents, or creative works remain with the client unless explicitly transferred by contract.</li>
    <li>Contributors may not use, reproduce, or distribute client materials without written consent.</li>
    <li>The Company does not claim ownership of any intellectual property unless expressly transferred by written agreement.</li>
    <li>Any final work delivered belongs to the client once payment obligations are fulfilled.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">6. Confidentiality</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
    <li>Clients and contributors must maintain strict confidentiality regarding project details, shared documents, and communications.</li>
    <li>The Company takes reasonable measures to safeguard confidential data but cannot guarantee complete security of online transmissions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
    <li>Satyartha Publishing is not liable for direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from services provided by contributors.</li>
    <li>The Company provides no warranties, express or implied, regarding contributor performance or the suitability of services for your specific needs.</li>
    <li>Our liability, if any, is limited to the administrative fees paid directly to the Company.</li>
  </ul>
