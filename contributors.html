    <h1>Our Contributors</h1>
    <p>With Satyartha, you'll connect with our network of professionals, whom we call <b>Contributors</b>. 
      Our platform encourages an <em>open-source approach to publishing talent</em>, which brings a highly cost-effective
       solution to your publishing challenges. By assigning a contributor directly to you, we eliminate the
        need for expensive, traditional corporate structures. 
        This binding agreement not only saves you money but also protects your intellectual
         property rights (IPR) by reducing unnecessary intermediaries.</p>
    <p>In addition, we ensure that our contributors are rewarded with the majority of the service charges,
       which encourages their participation, boosts morale, and fosters a healthy competition to provide the
          highest quality service to our clients.</p>
